# Custom CPU Simulator

This is a personal project to design and simulate a simple RISC-style CPU from scratch using Verilog, C++, and Python.  
It reinforces concepts from Computer System Architecture and Digital Logic Design.

## Project Phases
1. **Verilog CPU Core** - ALU, register file, instruction decoder, memory access
2. **C++ Assembler** - Converts simple assembly language into binary machine code
3. **Python Debugger** - Simulates and visualizes instruction execution

## How to Use
(Instructions will go here as each module is built.)

## Status
- [ ] Verilog CPU Design
- [ ] Assembler in C++
- [ ] Python Debugger
- [ ] Sample Programs
